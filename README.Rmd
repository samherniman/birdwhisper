## Test your knowledge of bird songs in any region

Birdwhisper searches community science databases for lists of birds in a given region. It then makes it easy to download bird calls from that area and test yourself in identifying the species.

## Installation

You can install the development version of birdwhisper from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("samherniman/birdwhisper")
```

## Example

Turn on the package with:

```{r example}
library(birdwhisper)
```

Make a list of bird species by supplying a location. The location can be the name of the place, like `"Vancouver, BC"` or an {sf} object

```{r example2}
spp_lst <- collect_species_list("Vancouver, BC")

head(spp_lst)
```

Use `search_xeno_canto()` to find recordings in Xeno Canto of each species in your species list. Then you can use `download_recordings()` to download a selection of them to your computer.

```{r eval=FALSE}
resps <- search_xeno_canto(spp_lst)
recs <- download_recordings(resps, save_directory = here::here())
```

`test_me()` will play each recording randomly and ask you to name the species you hear. Hopefully you will get better at naming each one over time.

```{r eval=FALSE}
test_me(recs)
```

At the moment, the tests are more like flashcards, where it just tells you the answer when you're ready. Later, I'd like to add multiple choice tests and true/false tests.

I hope this package encourages people to get outside!
